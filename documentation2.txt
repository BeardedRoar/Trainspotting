There are three methods in the monitor, enter, leave and isEmpty.
Enter is called whenever a train wants to enter a track and blocks the thread until the train is allowed to enter the 
monitored track. 

Leave is called whenever a train leaves a track and unlocks the monitored track for other trains.

IsEmpty returns a boolean telling whether or not the monitored track is empty. It is used to determine if a train can use
the fast track or has to use the slow one.

We are using one conditional variable in our monitor. At least one is needed so another thread can use the monitor's 
methods while the first one is waiting for something in order to avoid deadlocks. We did not need more then one 
because a train should always be allowed to leave a track if it was allowed to enter another.
